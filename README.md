# Black Market
## About The Team
* The Black Market team consists of 4 members all utilizing their technical skills to build a system to assist students with acquiring second-hand books all the more easier. Kenwood as the team leader, Vikash handling the main database architecture, Ado with both middleware and front end features and Natasha with front-end aesthetics and web page design, we have created a smooth, simple and pleasing website for students to navigate and acquire their needed books.
## Project Description

#### Problem
* Textbooks can incur a very large amount of finances spent on them as a student continues their educational career, and if that student does not have a bursary or sponsorship this can affect the resources that are available to them.

* So it’s not a surprise that most students would seek the second-hand market for their
textual resources. However, the university does not have a dedicated and reliable
service for assisting students with acquiring second-hand books.

* Most students have taken the initiative and begun selling their own books on campus
grounds. While not being a bad solution it does however, task the students with
searching for books amongst scattered sellers, buying from some what “unreliable”
students and students that sell the books may find it difficult to find buyers because of
poor discovery on campus.

#### Solution
* We have designed a solution that can alleviate most of the challenges encountered with the second-hand textbook service on campus with Bibliotheca.

* A B2C E-commerce website that provides a central digital bookstore for
students to both upload their used textbooks and buy textbooks from other
students

* This solution aims to solve the unreliable and tedious process of the
on-campus second hand book purchases by: being a central hub for used
textbooks, providing a reliable and convenient bookstore service and
allowing students an official channel for transactions

#### Stack 
* Node js Express
* mySQL
