## About The Team
###### The Black Market team consists of 4 members all utilizing their technical skills to build a system to assist students with acquiring second-hand books all the more easier. Kenwood as the team leader, Vikash handling the main database architecture, Ado with both middleware and front end features and Natasha with front-end aesthetics and web page design, we have created a smooth, simple and pleasing website for students to navigate and acquire their needed books.
## Problem
###### * Textbooks can incur a very large amount of finances spent on them as a student continues their educational career, and if that student does not have a bursary or sponsorship this can affect the resources that are available to them.
